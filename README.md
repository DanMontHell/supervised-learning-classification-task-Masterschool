# Supervised Classification of Vehicle Shapes

## üöó Project Overview

This project focuses on a **supervised classification problem** to distinguish between different types of vehicles based on their silhouette shapes. By leveraging various machine learning algorithms, we aim to build a robust model capable of accurately classifying vehicles into predefined categories. This is a classic example of a multi-class classification task where the goal is to predict a categorical label from a set of features.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **"Vehicle" dataset**, which contains features extracted from the silhouettes of different vehicles. The data consists of **846 instances** and **19 features**, with the target variable being the `class` of the vehicle. The classes are:

* **van** üöê
* **car** üöó
* **bus** üöå

The features are numerical and describe various shape properties of the vehicle silhouettes, such as **compactness**, **circularity**, and **radius ratio**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project follows a structured machine learning workflow:

1.  **Data Preprocessing**: The initial step involves cleaning the data, which includes handling missing values through **mean imputation**.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: **Univariate analysis** is performed to understand the distribution of each feature and identify any potential outliers or skewness.
3.  **Model Building**: A variety of supervised classification models are trained on the dataset, including:
    * **Logistic Regression**
    * **Decision Tree**
    * **Random Forest**
4.  **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is evaluated using various metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC AUC score** to determine the best-performing model for this classification task.

## üéØ Objective

The primary objective of this project is to compare the performance of different supervised learning algorithms on the vehicle shape classification problem and to identify the most effective model for this task. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for applications in automated vehicle recognition and classification systems.

## üìà Results and Insights

The performance of the different models was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Below is a summary of the results:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Logistic Regression | *0.95* | *0.96* | *0.96* | *0.96* |
| Decision Tree | *0.90* | *0.90* | *0.90* | *0.90* |
| Random Forest | *0.93* | *0.94* | *0.94* | *0.94* |

### Key Insights:

*Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy (0.95) after scaling, outperforming Decision Tree (0.90) and Random Forest (0.94).
*Cross-validation results for Logistic Regression (0.93 mean accuracy after stratification) were stable, confirming model generalizability.
*No signs of overfitting were detected, with training accuracy (0.94) aligning closely to test accuracy (0.96).

## üèÅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of various supervised machine learning algorithms for classifying vehicle shapes. The **Logistic Regression** model achieved the highest accuracy, making it the most suitable for this task. The results indicate that machine learning can be effectively used for automated vehicle classification based on shape features.

## üîÆ Next Steps

Further improvements and analysis can be conducted in the future:

* **Feature Engineering**: Explore creating new features from the existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
* **Try Other Models**: Experiment with other advanced classification algorithms like **Gradient Boosting**, **XGBoost**, or **LightGBM**.
* **Deep Learning**: For a more complex approach, a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** could be used to classify the vehicle images directly, rather than relying on extracted features.
* **Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model as a web application or an API to allow for real-time predictions.
